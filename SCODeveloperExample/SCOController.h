/*
	This little example will show you how to make your own
	SCO audio agent to support extended device features for Handsfree and Headset devices.
	On Leopard release we will only support the bare-minimum to make these devices work
	properly, anything extra is up to you.  

	We've made the device bring-up really simple as you'll see in the source counterpart
	of this file.  Included is a simple subclass of the IOBluetoothHandsFreeGateway 
	object, you'll be handling the feature data in there.

	You'll notice that there is a parser in main.m to support blued's launch args so 
	this app can be launch from incoming connections. There is however some work you'll need to 
	do to get it to work. To make this agent launch on incoming connections you'll need to either 
	change the "target application" setting in the Headset SDP record (plist) located in the 
	IOBluetooth framework Resources, or load up one of your own.  If you choose to change that 
	record you'll probably need to tickle the SDP system / blued to make sure it doesn't use the 
	cached version of the record.

	And thats pretty much it.  Set some features, add some handlers, change the SDP, and enjoy!
